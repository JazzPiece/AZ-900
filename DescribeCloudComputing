When using a cloud provider, you’ll always be responsible for:

    The information and data stored in the cloud
    Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
    The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:

    The physical datacenter
    The physical network
    The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

    Operating systems
    Network controls
    Applications
    Identity and infrastructure


# ☁️ AZ-900 Notes – Cloud Models

## ✅ Definitions

- [x] **Cloud model** – The deployment type of cloud resources (how and where they are delivered).
- [x] **Private cloud** – Cloud services used by a **single organization**. Greater control, higher cost. Hosted on-site or in a dedicated off-site facility.
- [x] **Public cloud** – Services offered by **third-party providers** over the internet, available to anyone. Most scalable and cost-effective.
- [x] **Hybrid cloud** – Combines **private and public** cloud environments. Useful for burst traffic, security flexibility, and app placement decisions.
- [x] **Multi-cloud** – Usage of **multiple public cloud providers** (e.g., Azure + AWS). Can be strategic or transitional.
- [x] **Azure Arc** – Azure’s management solution for hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Helps manage servers, Kubernetes clusters, and apps across environments.
- [x] **Azure VMware Solution** – Allows you to run VMware workloads on Azure without refactoring.
