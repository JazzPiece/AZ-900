## ✅ Key Concepts

| Term              | Definition |
|-------------------|------------|
| **High Availability** | Ensures that services/apps remain accessible and operational during failures or disruptions. |
| **Scalability**        | Ability to increase or decrease resources to meet demand. |

---

## ☁️ High Availability (HA)

- Ensures your app or service is **available when needed**
- Designed to handle **disruptions**, maintenance, or load spikes
- Enforced through Azure **SLAs (Service Level Agreements)**

---

## 🚀 Scalability

- **Scale up/down** based on actual usage
- Supports cost-efficiency: pay for what you need
- Two types:

### 🔼 Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Down)
- Increase/decrease capacity of a **single resource**
  - e.g., Add more CPU/RAM to a VM
- Pros: Simple
- Cons: Limited ceiling

### 🔁 Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/In)
- Add/remove **instances of a resource**
  - e.g., Add more VMs or containers
- Pros: Great for web apps, APIs, microservices
- Can be **manual or automatic**

## 🧠 Summary

| Feature | High Availability | Scalability |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Goal    | Maximize uptime   | Match resource supply to demand |
| Example | Redundant VMs in different zones | Add/remove containers dynamically |
| Benefit | User trust, reliability | Performance, cost-efficiency |

# 🔄 AZ-900 – Reliability and Predictability in the Cloud

## ✅ Key Definitions

| Term         | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| **Reliability** | The ability of a system to **recover from failures** and keep functioning. |
| **Predictability** | The ability to **anticipate system performance and costs**, ensuring consistency and confidence. |

---

## 🔒 Reliability

- Supported by the **decentralized design** of the cloud.
- Resources can be deployed in **multiple regions** around the world.
- Global redundancy = system resilience against **regional failures**.
- Azure may **automatically reroute services** if a region fails.
- It's one of the pillars of the **Azure Well-Architected Framework**.

---

## 📈 Predictability

### 💡 Performance Predictability
- Uses tools like:
  - **Autoscaling** – Add/remove resources based on real-time load
  - **Load Balancing** – Distribute traffic across servers/services
  - **High Availability** – Ensures uptime across zones

### 💰 Cost Predictability
- Real-time usage tracking and forecasting
- Tools like:
  - **Azure Pricing Calculator**
  - **TCO Calculator**
  - **Azure Cost Management + Budgets**
- Cloud analytics help **predict spend patterns** and optimize costs

---

## 🧠 Summary

| Benefit | What It Enables |
|---------|-----------------|
| Reliability | Systems keep working through failures (global resilience) |
| Performance Predictability | Users get consistent experience during scaling events |
| Cost Predictability | Teams can estimate, monitor, and control cloud expenses |

Management of the cloud

Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:

    Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
    Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
    Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
    Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.

Management in the cloud

Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:

    Through a web portal.
    Using a command line interface.
    Using APIs.
    Using PowerShell.

1. Which type of scaling involves adding or removing resources (such as virtual machines or containers) to meet demand?

✔️ Horizontal scaling

    This is also called scale out/in. You add or remove instances to adjust capacity (e.g., more VMs, containers).

2. What is characterized as the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function?

✔️ Reliability

    Reliability means the system stays available and operational even during failures — a key part of high availability and resilience.
