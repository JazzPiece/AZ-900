Unit: Describe Azure Storage Accounts
What is an Azure Storage Account?
A storage account provides a globally unique namespace for your Azure Storage data, accessible via HTTP/HTTPS.

It ensures security, durability, high availability, and massive scalability.

Storage Account Types & Use Cases
Type	Supported Services	Redundancy Options	Use Case Highlights
Standard general-purpose v2	Blob, Queue, Table, Azure Files, Data Lake Storage	LRS, GRS, RA-GRS, ZRS, GZRS, RA-GZRS	Default/recommended for most scenarios using Azure Storage
Premium block blobs	Blob Storage, Data Lake Storage	LRS, ZRS	High transaction rate, small objects, low latency
Premium file shares	Azure Files	LRS, ZRS	High-performance scale applications, supports SMB and NFS
Premium page blobs	Page blobs only	LRS	Specialized storage for page blobs only

Endpoint Structure
Each service in a storage account has a uniquely formatted endpoint:

Storage Service	Endpoint Format
Blob Storage	https://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net
Data Lake Gen2	https://<storage-account-name>.dfs.core.windows.net
Azure Files	https://<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net
Queue Storage	https://<storage-account-name>.queue.core.windows.net
Table Storage	https://<storage-account-name>.table.core.windows.net

Unit: Describe Azure Storage Redundancy
Azure Storage always replicates your data to protect against hardware failures, network outages, and disasters. The right redundancy option depends on your needs for cost, availability, and disaster recovery.

Redundancy Within a Primary Region
Redundancy Type	Description	Durability	Availability Zone Support	Notes
LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)	3 copies within a single data center	99.999999999% (11 nines)	❌	Lowest cost, lowest durability
ZRS (Zone-Redundant Storage)	3 copies across 3 availability zones in the same region	99.9999999999% (12 nines)	✅	High availability even if a zone fails

Redundancy Across Regions (Geo-Replication)
Redundancy Type	Primary	Secondary	Durability	Readable Without Failover?
GRS	LRS	LRS	16 nines	❌
RA-GRS	LRS	LRS	16 nines	✅
GZRS	ZRS	LRS	16 nines	❌
RA-GZRS	ZRS	LRS	16 nines	✅

Key Concepts
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Usually < 15 minutes. Data replicated asynchronously, so there may be recent data loss during a failover.

Read Access (RA-GRS/RA-GZRS): Lets you read data from the secondary region even before a failover is triggered.

ZRS/GZRS: Recommended for high-availability scenarios and regional compliance.

Unit: Describe Azure Storage Services
Main Services
Service	Purpose
Azure Blobs	Object storage for unstructured data (text, binary, video, logs, etc.)
Azure Files	Fully managed file shares via SMB/NFS
Azure Queues	Message queues for decoupling components, used with Azure Functions
Azure Disks	Managed block-level storage for VMs
Azure Tables	NoSQL storage for structured, non-relational data

Benefits of Azure Storage
Durable & Available: Redundancy protects data

Secure: Encrypted with fine-grained access control

Scalable: Grows with your data needs

Managed: Microsoft handles maintenance

Accessible: HTTP/HTTPS globally, with SDKs in many languages

Blob Storage Tiers
Tier	Use Case	Retention	Cost	Access Speed
Hot	Frequently accessed data	Any	High	Fast
Cool	Infrequently accessed ≥30 days	30+ days	Medium	Moderate
Cold	Rarely accessed ≥90 days	90+ days	Lower	Slower
Archive	Archival, rarely accessed ≥180 days	180+ days	Lowest	Slowest

Azure Files
Shared access via SMB or NFS

Managed file storage, supports Azure File Sync

Ideal for replacing on-prem file servers

Azure Queues
Message-based communication

Decouples app components

Scalable, reliable message storage

Azure Disks
Block storage for VMs (managed by Azure)

Easy to provision, highly available

Azure Tables
Scalable NoSQL datastore

Great for structured but non-relational data

Supports hybrid and multicloud access

Exercise: Create a Storage Blob in Azure
Step 1: Create a Storage Account
Go to: Azure Portal → Create a Resource → Storage → Storage Account → Create

Basics Tab:

Subscription: Concierge Subscription

Resource Group: The one starting with learn

Storage Account Name: Unique name

Performance: Standard

Redundancy: LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)

Advanced Tab:

Enable anonymous access on individual containers: Checked

Complete: Click Review → Create → Go to Resource

Step 2: Create a Blob Container
Navigate: Under Data Storage → Containers → + Container

Name: Your choice

Access Level: Private (no anonymous access)

Click Create

Step 3: Upload an Image Blob
Open the container, click Upload

Choose an image file from your computer and upload it

Step 4: Test Public Access
Open the blob → Go to Properties → Copy the URL

Paste the URL into a new browser tab → You'll get a 403 or 404 error

Step 5: Enable Public Read Access
Back in the Azure Portal, click Change Access Level

Set it to Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)

Click OK

Refresh your browser tab → Image should now load successfully

Identify Azure Data Migration Options
Azure Migrate
A hub for managing and tracking your move from on-premises to Azure.

Unified platform to assess and migrate infrastructure, apps, and data.

Tools include:

Discovery and Assessment – Evaluate on-prem servers (VMware, Hyper-V, physical).

Server Migration – Move VMs and physical servers to Azure.

Data Migration Assistant – Assess and prepare SQL databases.

Database Migration Service – Migrate databases to Azure SQL options.

App Service Migration Assistant – Move .NET and PHP web apps to Azure.

Azure Data Box
A physical device for transferring large data volumes (40–80 TB) offline.

Use when network is slow, costly, or unavailable.

Process:

Order a device from the portal.

Load your data locally.

Ship it back.

Microsoft uploads it to Azure.

Device is wiped clean to NIST standards.

Supports both import and export scenarios:

Import: Initial migrations, media libraries, VM/data moves.

Export: Disaster recovery, compliance needs, move to other cloud.

Azure File Movement Tools
AzCopy
Command-line tool for moving blobs or files.

Supports upload, download, and copying between storage accounts.

One-direction sync only (no bi-directional sync).

Can also interact with other cloud providers.

Azure Storage Explorer
GUI tool for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Uses AzCopy under the hood.

Allows uploading, downloading, and transferring between storage accounts via a graphical interface.

Azure File Sync
Turns your Windows File Server into a cloud-integrated server.

Bi-directionally syncs with Azure Files.

Key features:

Access via SMB, NFS, FTPS.

Multiple caches globally.

Cloud tiering keeps hot files local, cold files in Azure.

Easy recovery: install File Sync on a new server to restore access.

1. Which tool automatically keeps files between an on-premises Windows server and an Azure cloud environment updated?
Options:

Azure File Sync ✅ (Correct)

Azure Storage Explorer

AzCopy

Explanation:

Azure File Sync installs on your local Windows server and bi-directionally syncs data with Azure Files, meaning both locations stay up to date automatically.

Azure Storage Explorer is a GUI tool for manual uploads/downloads and management; it doesn't sync files.

AzCopy is a CLI tool for copying or syncing files in one direction only — it doesn't support automatic or bi-directional syncing.

2. Which storage redundancy option provides the highest degree of durability, with 16 nines of durability?
Options:

Locally redundant storage (LRS)

Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)

Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) ✅ (Correct)

Explanation:

Locally redundant storage (LRS): Replicates data within a single data center. Lowest durability.

Zone-redundant storage (ZRS): Replicates data across 3 availability zones in one region. More durable than LRS.

Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS): Combines ZRS in the primary region with geo-replication to a secondary region using LRS — offering 16 nines (99.99999999999999%) durability across regions. Highest among the three.

3. Which Azure Storage service supports big data analytics, as well as handling text and binary data types?
Options:

Azure Blobs ✅ (Correct)

Azure Files

Azure Disks

Explanation:

Azure Blobs: Object storage for large-scale unstructured data. Also supports Data Lake Storage Gen2, which is optimized for big data analytics.

Azure Files: Provides shared file storage (like SMB/NFS). Not intended for big data analytics.

Azure Disks: Provides block-level storage used primarily for Azure Virtual Machines. It's not designed for analytics or general blob storage.
