# 🌐 AZ-900 – Azure Physical Infrastructure

## 🏢 Core Concepts

Azure infrastructure consists of:
- **Physical infrastructure** (datacenters, regions, availability zones)
- **Management infrastructure** (covered in the next unit)

---

## 🏬 Datacenters

- Facilities with racks, power, cooling, and networking.
- Grouped into **Regions** and **Availability Zones**.
- You can’t deploy directly to a datacenter — deployments go to **regions**.

---

## 📍 Regions

- A **region** = 1 or more datacenters in a geographic area.
- Resources in a region are connected by **low-latency networks**.
- Some services/features are **region-specific** (e.g., VM sizes).
- Examples: West US, East US, East Asia.

---

## 🏛 Availability Zones (AZs)

- **Physically separate** datacenters within a region.
- Each zone has **independent power, cooling, and networking**.
- If one zone goes down, others keep running.
- AZs improve resiliency, especially for:
  - VMs
  - Managed disks
  - Load balancers
  - SQL databases

### Types of AZ support:

| Type                  | Description                            |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Zonal services        | You deploy to a specific zone (e.g., VM) |
| Zone-redundant        | Auto-replicated across zones (e.g., ZRS) |
| Non-regional services | Always available regardless of region  |

---

## 🗺 Region Pairs

- Most regions are **paired** with another ~300 miles away.
- Helps for disaster recovery and **failover**.
- Azure updates are rolled out **one region at a time**.
- **Data stays in the same geography** for compliance.

### Benefits:

- Prioritized recovery of at least one region
- Staggered updates
- Legal/data residency compliance

### Example Pairs:

| Region A      | Region B     |
|---------------|--------------|
| West US       | East US      |
| SE Asia       | East Asia    |

🔸 Some pairings are **one-directional** (e.g., Brazil South → South Central US)

---

## 🏛 Sovereign Regions

Isolated Azure instances for specific jurisdictions:

| Region Type     | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Azure Government** | For US Gov and DoD; run by screened US staff |
| **China Azure**      | Managed by 21Vianet, not directly by Microsoft |

---

## 🧠 Summary

| Component          | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Region**         | A group of datacenters in a geographic area |
| **Availability Zone** | Physically separate locations within a region |
| **Region Pair**    | Region + geographically distant backup region |
| **Sovereign Region** | Isolated Azure instance for compliance needs |

# 🛠️ AZ-900 – Azure Management Infrastructure

## 📦 Azure Resources and Resource Groups

- A **resource** is any Azure service you create (VM, DB, storage, etc.)
- A **resource group (RG)** is a logical container for related resources

### Key Points

- Every resource must be in **one** resource group
- **Cannot nest** resource groups
- Deleting a resource group deletes **all** contained resources
- Assigning access at RG level applies to all resources inside

### Use Cases

- Group resources by environment (e.g., dev, test)
- Group by access control needs
- Simplifies provisioning and cleanup

---

## 💳 Azure Subscriptions

- A **subscription** organizes **resource groups** and handles **billing and access**
- Required to use Azure
- Linked to an **Azure account** (identity in Microsoft Entra ID)

### Subscription Boundaries

| Type            | Purpose                                           |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Billing**       | Separate invoices per subscription               |
| **Access control**| Apply RBAC and policies across RGs in a subscription |

### Use Cases

- Separate **dev/prod environments**
- Map to **teams or departments**
- Track **billing** for different projects

---

## 🧰 Azure Management Groups

- Organize **multiple subscriptions** into one container
- Policies and RBAC applied at MG level are **inherited** by all child subscriptions, RGs, and resources
- Allows for **enterprise-wide** governance at scale

### Examples

- Apply policy: Restrict VM location to West US at MG level
- Assign RBAC role once to give access across multiple subscriptions

### Key Facts

- Up to **10,000** MGs per directory
- Up to **6 levels** of nesting (not including root or subscription)
- Each MG or subscription can only have **one parent**

---

## 🧠 Hierarchy Overview

Management Group
└── Subscription
└── Resource Group
└── Resource


Each layer inherits settings from the one above — great for centralized policy, access control, and billing management.


# 🧪 AZ-900 – Exercise: Create an Azure Resource

## 🎯 Goal

Create a Virtual Machine (VM) using the Azure Portal and observe how related resources are grouped within a **resource group**.

---

## ✅ Task 1: Create a Virtual Machine

Steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Select: **Create a resource** → **Virtual Machine** → **Create**
3. Fill in the **Basics** tab with the following:

| Setting                 | Value                            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Subscription            | Concierge Subscription           |
| Resource group          | Select one starting with `learn` |
| Virtual machine name    | `my-VM`                          |
| Authentication type     | Password                         |
| Username                | `azureuser`                      |
| Password                | Enter a custom password          |
| Public inbound ports    | None                             |

> Leave all other settings as default.

4. Click **Review and Create**
5. Click **Create**
6. Wait for **Deployment is complete**

---

## ✅ Task 2: Verify Resources Created

1. Go to **Home** → **Resource groups**
2. Select your **sandbox resource group** (starts with `learn`)
3. Review the list of resources:
   - Some (e.g., storage account, VNet) are sandbox defaults
   - Others (e.g., VM, NIC, disk, NSG) were created with your VM

Azure **auto-names and groups** related resources for clarity.

---

## 🧹 Clean Up

- **No manual cleanup needed** – sandbox deletes resources automatically
- In real projects:
  - Delete individual resources **or**
  - Delete the **entire resource group** to remove all

---

## 💡 Takeaway

Creating a VM triggers the creation of **multiple dependent resources**.
Azure automatically groups them under the same **resource group** for easier management and cleanup.


How many resource groups can a resource be in at the same time?
✅ One

What happens to the resources within a resource group when an action or setting at the Resource Group level is applied?
