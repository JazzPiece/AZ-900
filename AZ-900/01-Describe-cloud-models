# ☁️ AZ-900 Notes – Part 1: Cloud Concepts

## 1. What is Cloud Computing?
### ✅ Definition
**Cloud computing** is the **delivery of computing services over the internet**.

### 🧱 Cloud Services Include:
- Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Storage
- Databases
- Networking
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### ⚡ Key Benefit
- **Scalable on demand**  
  No need to build a new datacenter — cloud lets you **expand your IT infrastructure instantly**.

### 🧠 Why It Matters
Cloud computing:
- Removes dependency on physical infrastructure
- Provides flexible access to modern IT services
- Powers fast deployment and innovation

## 2. Cloud Deployment Models

### ✅ Definitions
- **Public cloud** – Provided by third-party vendors, shared resources, scalable and cost-effective.
- **Private cloud** – Used by a single organization, high control and security, higher cost.
- **Hybrid cloud** – Combines public and private, flexible and secure.
- **Multi-cloud** – Use of multiple public cloud providers (e.g., Azure + AWS).
- **Azure Arc** – Unified management across public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud.
- **Azure VMware Solution** – Run VMware workloads natively on Azure.

### ☁️ Cloud Model Comparison

| Public Cloud | Private Cloud | Hybrid Cloud |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| No CapEx to scale | Full control over infra | Most flexible |
| Fast provisioning | Isolated data | Choose where to run workloads |
| Pay-as-you-go | High upfront hardware cost | Control over compliance/security |
| Less control | You maintain hardware | Combines public/private advantages |

## 3. Cloud Pricing Concepts

### ✅ CapEx vs OpEx

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **CapEx** | Upfront investment | Buy servers, build datacenter |
| **OpEx** | Pay-as-you-go | Cloud services, software licenses |

### ☁️ Consumption-Based Model
- Pay only for what you use
- No upfront cost
- No overprovisioning or waste
- Instantly scale up/down

### 🏗 Traditional vs Cloud

| Traditional (CapEx) | Cloud (OpEx) |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Estimate future needs | Scale to match real usage |
| Risk of waste | Efficient resource use |
| Long setup time | Immediate provisioning |
| Must manage infra | Infra managed for you |

## 4. Shared Responsibility Model

### ✅ What is It?
A model that defines which responsibilities are handled by:
- **You (the customer)**
- **Cloud provider**
- Based on service model: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

### 🔄 Responsibility Table

| Responsibility | You | Provider |
|----------------|-----|----------|
| Data | ✅ | ❌ |
| Access & Identity | ✅ | ❌ |
| Devices | ✅ | ❌ |
| Datacenter | ❌ | ✅ |
| Physical Network | ❌ | ✅ |

### ⚙️ Service Model Overview

| Model | You manage | Provider manages |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| **IaaS** | OS, apps, data | Infra |
| **PaaS** | Apps, data | OS, runtime, infra |
| **SaaS** | Data, users | Everything else |

### 📌 Real-World Examples

| Scenario | Who manages? |
|----------|--------------|
| SQL DB on Azure (PaaS) | Provider handles infra, you manage data |
| SQL on your VM (IaaS) | You manage VM, SQL, patches |
