- Databases
- Networking
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

---

## ‚ö° Key Benefit

---

## üß† Why It Matters

Cloud computing:
- Removes dependency on physical infrastructure
- Provides flexible access to modern IT services
- Powers fast deployment and innovation

# üõ° AZ-900 ‚Äì Shared Responsibility Model

## ‚úÖ What is It?

A **security model** that defines who (you vs. the cloud provider) is responsible for what in the cloud.

In a **traditional datacenter**, your company is responsible for everything.  
In the **cloud**, responsibility is **shared** depending on the **service model** (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).

---

## üîÑ Core Concept

| Responsibility           | Consumer (You)                              | Cloud Provider                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Data & Information       | ‚úÖ Always your responsibility                | ‚ùå                                      |
| Identity & Access        | ‚úÖ You manage users, roles, devices          | ‚ùå                                      |
| Devices (PCs, phones)    | ‚úÖ You secure endpoints                      | ‚ùå                                      |
| Physical datacenter      | ‚ùå                                           | ‚úÖ Always their responsibility         |
| Physical network & hosts | ‚ùå                                           | ‚úÖ                                      |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Service Models & Responsibility

| Model | Who manages what? |
|-------|-------------------|
| **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) | You manage OS, apps, data. Provider handles physical infra. |
| **PaaS** (Platform as a Service)       | You manage apps & data. Provider handles OS & runtime.       |
| **SaaS** (Software as a Service)       | You manage only data & users. Provider handles everything else. |

---

When using a cloud provider, you‚Äôll always be responsible for:

    The information and data stored in the cloud
    Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
    The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:

    The physical datacenter
    The physical network
    The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

    Operating systems
    Network controls
    Applications
    Identity and infrastructure

## üìå Real Example

| Scenario | Who is responsible? |
|----------|---------------------|
| SQL DB hosted by provider (PaaS) | Provider manages patching, **you** manage data & access |
| SQL DB installed on VM (IaaS) | **You** manage everything: VM, SQL, patches, security |



## ‚úÖ Definitions

- [x] **Cloud model** ‚Äì The deployment type of cloud resources (how and where they are delivered).
- [x] **Private cloud** ‚Äì Cloud services used by a **single organization**. Greater control, higher cost. Hosted on-site or in a dedicated off-site facility.
- [x] **Public cloud** ‚Äì Services offered by **third-party providers** over the internet, available to anyone. Most scalable and cost-effective.
- [x] **Hybrid cloud** ‚Äì Combines **private and public** cloud environments. Useful for burst traffic, security flexibility, and app placement decisions.
- [x] **Multi-cloud** ‚Äì Usage of **multiple public cloud providers** (e.g., Azure + AWS). Can be strategic or transitional.
- [x] **Azure Arc** ‚Äì Azure‚Äôs management solution for hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Helps manage servers, Kubernetes clusters, and apps across environments.
- [x] **Azure VMware Solution** ‚Äì Allows you to run VMware workloads on Azure without refactoring.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment Models ‚Äì Comparison Table

| **Public cloud**                                    | **Private cloud**                                                             | **Hybrid cloud**                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No capital expenditures to scale up                  | Organizations have complete control over resources and security               | Provides the most flexibility                                   |
| Applications can be quickly provisioned/deprovisioned| Data is not collocated with other organizations‚Äô data                          | Organizations determine where to run their applications         |
| Organizations pay only for what they use             | Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance                        | Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements |
| Organizations don‚Äôt have complete control            | Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates            |                                                                |

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Additional Cloud Deployment Scenarios

### üîÑ Multi-Cloud
- Involves using **multiple public cloud providers** (e.g., Azure + AWS).
- Common scenarios:
  - Using different services from different providers.
  - Migrating from one provider to another.
- Requires managing **resources and security** across **multiple platforms**.

### üß≠ Azure Arc
- A **management platform** for hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
- Works with:
  - Public cloud (Azure)
  - Private cloud (on-premises)
  - Hybrid setups
  - Multi-cloud (e.g., Azure + AWS)
- Enables consistent **governance, configuration, and monitoring** across all environments.

### üß± Azure VMware Solution
- Lets you **run existing VMware workloads in Azure**.
- Useful when:
  - You're already using VMware in a private cloud.
  - You want to **migrate** or **extend** to a public/hybrid cloud without refactoring.
- Provides seamless **integration and scalability** into Azure.

## ‚úÖ CapEx vs OpEx

| Expense Type | Description | Examples |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **CapEx (Capital Expenditure)** | One-time, upfront investments in physical assets | Buying servers, building a datacenter, company vehicles |
| **OpEx (Operational Expenditure)** | Ongoing expenses for services/products consumed over time | Cloud subscriptions, software licenses, leasing hardware |

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è What is the Consumption-Based Model?

- A **cloud pricing model** where you pay only for what you use.
- No cost if you don‚Äôt consume any resources during a billing cycle.
- Resources (compute, storage, networking) are **rented**, not owned.

---

## üí° Benefits

- [x] No upfront hardware costs
- [x] No over-provisioning or waste
- [x] Pay **more** only when usage increases
- [x] Pay **less** or stop paying when usage drops
- [x] Avoid datacenter capacity planning & delays

---

## üèó Traditional Datacenter vs. Cloud

| Traditional Model (CapEx)                 | Cloud Model (OpEx)                     |
|-----------------------------------        |----------------------------------------|
| Estimate future capacity                  | Scale up/down based on actual need     |
| Over/underprovision = wasted $ or outages | Pay only for what you use            |
| Long lead time to expand capacity         | Instantly deploy or remove resources   |
| Must manage power, cooling, hardware      | Provider handles all infra            |

---

## üß† Summary

Cloud computing turns infrastructure into a **utility** ‚Äî you rent compute/storage like you'd rent electricity or office space.

- When you're done with a resource ‚Üí **deallocate it**
- Billing is **based on usage**
- Lets you **focus on business**, not infrastructure
