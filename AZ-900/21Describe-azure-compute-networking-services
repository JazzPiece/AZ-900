# 🖥️ AZ-900 – Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

## ✅ What is an Azure VM?

A **virtual machine (VM)** is an IaaS compute resource that provides a virtualized server.  
It gives you control over the OS, installed software, and hosting configuration — similar to managing a physical server.

### 🧰 Key Features

- Full control over the OS
- Custom software support
- Supports “lift and shift” from on-prem
- Pay only for what you use (consumption model)

---

## 🚀 VM Images

- VMs can be provisioned from **images**
- Images are templates that include:
  - OS
  - Pre-installed software (e.g. Dev tools, Web servers)

---

## 📈 Scaling & High Availability

### 🔁 Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)

- Automatically deploy, scale, and manage **identical** VMs
- Load balanced by default
- Scales in/out automatically based on demand or schedule
- Ideal for compute, big data, containers

### 🧩 Virtual Machine Availability Sets

- Improves **resiliency and uptime**
- Protects against **single points of failure**
- Uses:
  - **Update domains**: Control which VMs update together
  - **Fault domains**: Distribute VMs across power/network racks
- No additional cost — you pay for the VM instances only

---

## 🧠 Common VM Use Cases

- **Dev/Test Environments** – Quickly spin up or tear down setups
- **Cloud Applications** – Deploy scalable, cloud-hosted apps
- **Datacenter Extension** – Connect Azure VMs to on-prem network
- **Disaster Recovery** – Use cloud VMs during on-prem failure
- **Lift and Shift** – Move physical servers to cloud with minimal changes

---

## 🔧 VM Resource Configuration

When provisioning a VM, you choose:

| Component       | Example                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Size**         | Number of cores, RAM                      |
| **Disks**        | HDD or SSD                                |
| **Networking**   | VNet, public IP, ports                    |

> You are responsible for patching, updates, and managing installed OS/software inside the VM.

# 🛠️ AZ-900 – Exercise: Create an Azure VM and Install Nginx (CLI)

## 🔧 Objective

Here’s a streamlined summary of Azure Virtual Networking for your AZ-900 notes:

🌐 Azure Virtual Networking
Azure virtual networks (VNets) are private, isolated networks in the cloud that let your Azure resources securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

🛠️ Core Features
Capability	Description
Isolation & segmentation	Define IP ranges, subnets, and control traffic between them
Internet communication	Assign public IPs or use load balancers for access
Resource communication	Connect VMs, App Services, AKS, etc., within or across VNets
On-prem integration	Connect via VPN or ExpressRoute
Traffic routing	Use route tables or BGP to control flow
Traffic filtering	Use NSGs or firewalls (NVAs) for security
VNet Peering	Connect VNets (even across regions) over Microsoft backbone

🌍 Public vs Private Endpoints
Public: Has a public IP, accessible over the internet

Private: Uses internal IP from within the VNet

🔐 Traffic Filtering Tools
NSGs (Network Security Groups): Rule-based filtering by IP, port, protocol

NVAs (Network Virtual Appliances): Custom firewall/WAN optimization VMs

🔁 On-Premises Connectivity
Type	Use Case
Point-to-site VPN	Connect from a client device (like a laptop) to Azure
Site-to-site VPN	Securely connect on-prem network to Azure VNet
ExpressRoute	Private, high-bandwidth, low-latency connection (bypasses internet)

🔄 Routing Control
User-Defined Routes (UDR): Override default system routes

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol): Auto-learn and advertise routes via VPN or ExpressRoute

🧩 VNet Peering
Directly link VNets

Traffic stays private and on Microsoft’s backbone

Enables global, secure, scalable connectivity

Here’s a summarized set of notes from the “Configure Network Access” exercise in your AZ-900 training:

🔐 Configure Network Access for Azure VM (Nginx Setup)
❗ Problem
After creating a VM and installing Nginx, you couldn't access the web server.

Reason: Port 80 (HTTP) not open in the VM's Network Security Group (NSG).

⚙️ Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. Check if VM is Running
bash
Copy
Edit
az vm list
2. Get VM IP
bash
Copy
Edit
IPADDRESS="$(az vm list-ip-addresses \
  --resource-group "<your-rg-name>" \
  --name my-vm \
  --query "[].virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[*].ipAddress" \
  --output tsv)"
3. Test Access to Nginx
bash
Copy
Edit
curl --connect-timeout 5 http://$IPADDRESS
Result: ❌ Connection timed out

📜 Check NSG Rules
bash
Copy
Edit
az network nsg rule list \
  --resource-group "<your-rg-name>" \
  --nsg-name my-vmNSG \
  --query '[].{Name:name, Priority:priority, Port:destinationPortRange, Access:access}' \
  --output table
Shows: Only port 22 (SSH) is open.

✅ Allow Port 80 (HTTP)
bash
Copy
Edit
az network nsg rule create \
  --resource-group "<your-rg-name>" \
  --nsg-name my-vmNSG \
  --name allow-http \
  --protocol tcp \
  --priority 100 \
  --destination-port-range 80 \
  --access Allow
🌐 Retest Web Access
bash
Copy
Edit
curl --connect-timeout 5 http://$IPADDRESS
Expected: ✅ Returns HTML response: Welcome to Azure! My name is my-vm.

🧼 Tip
You can reuse NSGs across multiple VMs to apply consistent access rules.

Always clean up unused resources to avoid costs.

Here's a clean summary of the "Describe Azure Virtual Private Networks" section for your AZ-900 notes:

🔐 Azure Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
A VPN uses an encrypted tunnel over a public network (like the internet) to securely connect trusted networks or devices.

🔗 Azure VPN Gateway
A VPN gateway is a virtual network gateway deployed in a dedicated subnet. It enables:

Site-to-site connections (on-premises to Azure)

Point-to-site connections (individual device to Azure)

Network-to-network connections (VNet to VNet)

🔒 All traffic is encrypted during transit.

🔄 VPN Types
Type	Description
Policy-based	Uses static IP rules to determine which packets to encrypt.
Route-based	Uses virtual tunnel interfaces with dynamic/static routing. Preferred for complex, scalable topologies.

Use route-based VPNs for:

VNet-to-VNet connections

Point-to-site

Multisite

Coexistence with ExpressRoute

🚀 High Availability Options
Active/Standby (default)

Two gateway instances

Auto-failover

Downtime: a few seconds (planned) or ~90 sec (unplanned)

Active/Active (with BGP)

Two unique public IPs

Separate tunnels to each

Can extend HA with on-prem redundancy

ExpressRoute Failover

VPN gateway as backup path

Ensures connectivity if ExpressRoute fails

Zone-Redundant Gateways

Spread across availability zones

Higher resiliency and availability

Requires specific SKUs and Standard public IPs

ChatGPT said:
Here’s a summarized version of the “Describe Azure ExpressRoute” section for your AZ-900 notes:

🌐 Azure ExpressRoute
ExpressRoute is a private connection between your on-premises network and Microsoft cloud (Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365) — not over the public internet.

✅ Key Benefits
Private connectivity = no public internet exposure

High reliability, consistent latency, better security

Global connectivity via ExpressRoute Global Reach

Dynamic routing with BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

Built-in redundancy at every peering location

🔗 Supported Connectivity Types
CloudExchange colocation

You colocate at a cloud exchange like an ISP and request a virtual cross-connection.

Point-to-point Ethernet

Direct connection from your facility to Azure.

Any-to-any (IP VPN)

Integrates with your existing WAN to connect multiple branch sites.

ExpressRoute Direct

Direct connection to Microsoft backbone (10–100 Gbps); supports active/active architecture.

🌍 Global Reach
Connect on-prem sites across regions using Microsoft’s backbone

Example: Asia office and EU datacenter can securely communicate

🔐 Security Note
Data over ExpressRoute is private

But: DNS queries, CRL checks, and Azure CDN traffic still use the public internet
